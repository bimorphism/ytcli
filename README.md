# ytcli
Command line interface for YouTube written in Rust ðŸ¦€

## Requirements
- youtube-dl, get this from your distros package manager
- rust/cargo

## Motivation
---------
The motivation behind writing ytcli was that I feel that YouTube has become a
bloated piece of trash akin to Facebook and (most) other social networks online.

By creating ytcli, I hope to offer an alternative to relying on big tech and
bloated JavaScript code. ytcli has no ads, an efficient and easy to use CLI based
interface and uses libre technology like youtube-dl for searching, and mpv/mplayer (editable in config but mpv by default) for playback.
